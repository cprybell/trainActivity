# trainActivity

## Creator: Chad Prybell

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to track trains and when they will arrive next. This is then displayed on the webpage in an easy to read format. The user can add new trains to track and these trains will be added to the display as well. The train info is stored in a database, so when the webpage is reloaded the train info will still be displayed.

## How to start
Add a train using the prompt at the bottom of the webpage. After clicking submit the train should appear in the tracked train display. Refresh the webpage to update the times until the next train arrives.
